# Bit-Processing-with-PS2-Keyboard-FPGA-
Bit processing step by step on nexys a7 with a connectod keyboard.
XILINX NEXYS-A7 100T FPGA
With all button press we can active our bit adder (50=110010). PS2 Keyboards have formable 10 Bit. First and last bits are start and partiy bit. We can use the keyboard character with 8 bits in between. All Charachters have different 8bits. After the registering of ps2 and button data with D-FF we can manage the bits with buttons and ps2 keyboard keys.
